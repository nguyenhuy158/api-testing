# SpringCommerce
## Problem statement
A small start-up named "SpringCommerce" wants to build a very simple online shopping application to sell their products. In order to get to the market quickly, they just want to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version with a very limited set of functionalities:
- [x] ~~1. The application is simply a simple web page that shows all
products on which customers can filter and search for products
based on different criteria such as product category, name, price,
brand, color.~~
- [x] ~~2. If the customer finds a product that they like, they can view its
details and add it to their shopping cart and proceed to place an
order.~~
- [x] ~~3. No online payment is supported yet. The customer is required to
pay by cash when the product got delivered.~~

## Delivery Requirements
- [x] ~~1. Build a Java Spring Boot application to perform all operations
stated above. The data of the application should be stored in
MySQL or Postgres DBMS.~~
- [x] ~~2. Implementation of the following operations:~~
  - [x] ~~Get a list of products by filtering multiple criteria including
  category, price, brand, color.~~
  - [x] ~~Add a product to shopping cart.~~
  - [x] ~~Check out the order.~~
- [x] 3. ~~Implementation of APIs to perform CRUD operations on the data of
products, orders in the application.~~
- [ ] 4. Entity-relationship diagram for the database and solution diagrams
for the components, infrastructure design if any.
- [ ] 5. An acceptable amount of unit tests should be covered.
- [x] ~~6. Readme file includes:~~
  - [ ] A brief explanation for software development principles, patterns
  and practices being applied.
  - [ ] A brief explanation for the code structure.
  - [ ] All required steps in order to get the application run on a local
  computer.
  - [ ] Full CURL commands or Postman snapshots to verify the APIs
  (include full request endpoints, HTTP Headers and request payload
  if any).
